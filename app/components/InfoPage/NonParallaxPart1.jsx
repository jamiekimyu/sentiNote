                    <p className="text-light">Journaling has scientifically proven stress-reducing, goal-orienting benefits when done regularly. It can also be therapeutic for individuals in high-stress jobs, and can even help to curb depression. Our experience at a coding bootcamp has been quite stressful at times, and this motivated us to make an application that could be used for self-reflection. </p>
                    <p className="text-light">However, sentiment analysis as a human process is slow. It takes time to figure out how we feel. Sentimentum solves this problem by making sentiment analysis fast, accessible, and open to a variety of inputs.</p>
